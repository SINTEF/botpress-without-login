# BotPress without a login screen

This repository is a script to build a [BotPress](https://botpress.com) version without a user login screen. The login screen may be unnecessary if you run BotPress locally on your laptop. You **must not** expose this kind of BotPress installation to the Internet.

## This is not great software, use at your own risk

This repository is a quick workaround, and we do not recommend using it without understanding the changes. It automatically registers and creates the user with hardcoded anonymous credentials using the admin web user interface. You may see the login screen very briefly. This installation is not secure on its own. If you run it on your laptop, consider checking your firewall settings to prevent people on the same network from accessing BotPress.
